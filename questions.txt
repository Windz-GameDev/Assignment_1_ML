1. Based on what you accomplished on steps 3 and 4, answer this question.
Only looking at the mean of cross validation scores, which of the two
models, K-Nearest Neighbors model and the Artificial Neural Networks model,
is better?

Your answer: Looking only at the mean of the cross validation scores, it appears that the Artificial Neural Networks model is superior as 
as its mean error is smaller. That is, the average difference between the predicted value and the actual value. Obviously
we would prefer to choose the model that minimizes our error, and best generalizes to new, unseen datasets.

2. Based on what you accomplished on steps 5 and 6, answer this question.
What is the best KNN model hyperparameter based your grid search?

Your answer: The best hyperparameter combination returned by the GridSearch through all 36 possible combinations of the hyperparameter values based on the scoring metric, 
negative mean squared error is the following : {'algorithm': 'auto', 'n_neighbors': 10, 'p': 1}. What this means is, if we use the KNN Regressor Model with these hyperparameters 
to predict values for data similiar to our training data, this model configuration is expected to have superior predictions to other KNN Regressor Models of a different 
configuration, i.e, different hyperparameters.

(Note there may be non-deterministicness in your experiments so that the errors
your program computes may vary.  As such, your answers here should be
consistent with the error results shown in your Jupyter Notebook.)
